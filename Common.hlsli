// The projected position is a required output from all vertex shaders - where the vertex is on the screen
// The world position and normal at the vertex are sent to the pixel shader for the lighting equations.

// Constant Buffers
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// These structures are "constant buffers" - a way of passing variables over from C++ to the GPU
// They are called constants but that only means they are constant for the duration of a single GPU draw call.
// These "constants" correspond to variables in C++ that we will change per-model, or per-frame etc.

// In this exercise the matrices used to position the camera are updated from C++ to GPU every frame along with lighting information
// These variables must match exactly the gPerFrameConstants structure in Scene.cpp

{
    float4x4 gViewMatrix;
    float4x4 gProjectionMatrix;

    float3   gLight1Position; // 3 floats: x, y z
    float    padding1;        // Pad above variable to float4 (HLSL requirement - copied in the the C++ version of this structure)

    float    gSpecularPower;

    float3   gCameraPosition;
    float    padding5;
}
// Note constant buffers are not structs: we don't use the name of the constant buffer, these are really just a collection of global variables (hence the 'g')



// If we have multiple models then we need to update the world matrix from C++ to GPU multiple times per frame because we
// only have one world matrix here. Because this data is updated more frequently it is kept in a different buffer for better performance.
// We also keep other data that changes per-model here
// These variables must match exactly the gPerModelConstants structure in Scene.cpp
cbuffer PerModelConstants : register(b1) // The b1 gives this constant buffer the number 1 - used in the C++ code
{
    float4x4 gWorldMatrix;
